A class can have references to objects of other classes as members. This is called composition
and is sometimes referred to as a has-a relationship. For example, an AlarmClock object
needs to know the current time and the time when it’s supposed to sound its alarm,
so it’s reasonable to include two references to Time objects in an AlarmClock object. A car
has-a steering wheel, a break pedal and an accelerator pedal.
