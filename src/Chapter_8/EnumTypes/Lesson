Each enum declaration declares an enum class with the following restrictions:
1. enum constants are implicitly final.
2. enum constants are implicitly static.
3. Any attempt to create an object of an enum type with operator new results in a
compilation error.
The enum constants can be used anywhere constants can be used, such as in the case labels
of switch statements and to control enhanced for statements.
