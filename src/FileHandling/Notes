File handling in Java using FileWriter and FileReader

Java FileWriter and FileReader classes are used to write
and read data from text files (they are Character Stream
classes). It is recommended not to use the FileInputStream
and FileOutputStream classes if you have to read and
write any textual information as these are Byte stream
classes.

FileWriter class

Constructors:

FileWriter(File file) – Constructs a FileWriter object given a File object.
FileWriter (File file, boolean append) – constructs a FileWriter object given a File object.
FileWriter (FileDescriptor fd) – constructs a FileWriter object associated with a file descriptor.
FileWriter (String fileName) – constructs a FileWriter object given a file name.
FileWriter (String fileName, Boolean append) – Constructs a FileWriter object given a file name with a Boolean indicating whether or not to append the data written.

Methods:

public void write (int c) throws IOException – Writes a single character.
public void write (char [] stir) throws IOException – Writes an array of characters.
public void write(String str)throws IOException – Writes a string.
public void write(String str,int off,int len)throws IOException – Writes a portion of a string. Here off is offset from which to start writing characters and len is number of character to write.
public void flush() throws IOException flushes the stream
public void close() throws IOException flushes the stream first and then closes the writer.

## BufferedWriter can be used along with FileWriter to improve speed of execution.

FileReader

FileReader is useful to read data in the form of characters from a ‘text’ file.

This class inherit from the InputStreamReader Class.
The constructors of this class assume that the default character encoding and the default byte-buffer size are appropriate. To specify these values yourself, construct an InputStreamReader on a FileInputStream.
FileReader is meant for reading streams of characters. For reading streams of raw bytes, consider using a FileInputStream.

Constructors:

FileReader(File file) – Creates a FileReader , given the File to read from
FileReader(FileDescripter fd) – Creates a new FileReader , given the FileDescriptor to read from
FileReader(String fileName) – Creates a new FileReader , given the name of the file to read from
