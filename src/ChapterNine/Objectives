This chapter continues our discussion of object-oriented programming (OOP) by introducing
inheritance, in which a new class is created by acquiring an existing classâ€™s members
and possibly embellishing them with new or modified capabilities. With inheritance,
you can save time during program development by basing new classes on existing proven
and debugged high-quality software. This also increases the likelihood that a system will
be implemented and maintained effectively.

Organizations develop their own class libraries and can take advantage of others available worldwide. Some day, most
new software likely will be constructed from standardized reusable components, just as
automobiles and most computer hardware are constructed today. This will facilitate the
rapid development of more powerful, abundant and economical software.
