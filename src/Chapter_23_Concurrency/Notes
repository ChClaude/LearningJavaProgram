When we say that two tasks are operating concurrently, we mean that they’re both making progress at once.

When we say that two tasks are operating in parallel, we mean that they’re executing
simultaneously. In this sense, parallelism is a subset of concurrency. The human body performs
a great variety of operations in parallel. Respiration, blood circulation, digestion,
thinking and walking, for example, can occur in parallel, as can all the senses—sight,
hearing, touch, smell and taste. It’s believed that this parallelism is possible because the
human brain is thought to contain billions of “processors.” Today’s multi-core computers
have multiple processors that can perform tasks in parallel.
