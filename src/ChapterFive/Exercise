5.15 (Triangle Printing Program) Write an application that displays the following patterns separately,
one below the other. Use for loops to generate the patterns. All asterisks (*) should be printed
by a single statement of the form System.out.print('*'); which causes the asterisks to print side
by side. A statement of the form System.out.println(); can be used to move to the next line. A
statement of the form System.out.print(' '); can be used to display a space for the last two patterns.
There should be no other output statements in the program. [Hint: The last two patterns require
that each line begin with an appropriate number of blank spaces.]

5.20 (Calculating the Value of π) Calculate the value of π from the infinite series
Print a table that shows the value of π approximated by computing the first 200,000 terms of this
series. How many terms do you have to use before you first get a value that begins with 3.14159?

5.21 (Pythagorean Triples) A right triangle can have sides whose lengths are all integers. The set
of three integer values for the lengths of the sides of a right triangle is called a Pythagorean triple.
The lengths of the three sides must satisfy the relationship that the sum of the squares of two of the
sides is equal to the square of the hypotenuse. Write an application that displays a table of the
Pythagorean triples for side1, side2 and the hypotenuse, all no larger than 500. Use a triple-nested
for loop that tries all possibilities. This method is an example of “brute-force” computing. You’ll
learn in more advanced computer science courses that for many interesting problems there’s no
known algorithmic approach other than using sheer brute force.

5.22 (Modified Triangle Printing Program) Modify Exercise 5.15 to combine your code from
the four separate triangles of asterisks such that all four patterns print side by side. [Hint: Make clever
use of nested for loops.]

Making a Difference
5.31 (Global Warming Facts Quiz) The controversial issue of global warming has been widely
publicized by the film “An Inconvenient Truth,” featuring former Vice President Al Gore. Mr. Gore
and a U.N. network of scientists, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, shared the 2007
Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of “their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge
about man-made climate change.” Research both sides of the global warming issue online (you
might want to search for phrases like “global warming skeptics”). Create a five-question multiplechoice
quiz on global warming, each question having four possible answers (numbered 1–4). Be objective
and try to fairly represent both sides of the issue. Next, write an application that administers
the quiz, calculates the number of correct answers (zero through five) and returns a message to the
user. If the user correctly answers five questions, print “Excellent”; if four, print “Very good”; if
three or fewer, print “Time to brush up on your knowledge of global warming,” and include a list
of some of the websites where you found your facts.

5.32 (Tax Plan Alternatives; The “FairTax”) There are many proposals to make taxation fairer.
Check out the FairTax initiative in the United States at www.fairtax.org. Research how the proposed
FairTax works. One suggestion is to eliminate income taxes and most other taxes in favor of
a 23% consumption tax on all products and services that you buy. Some FairTax opponents question
the 23% figure and say that because of the way the tax is calculated, it would be more accurate
to say the rate is 30%—check this carefully. Write a program that prompts the user to enter expenses
in various expense categories they have (e.g., housing, food, clothing, transportation, education,
health care, vacations), then prints the estimated FairTax that person would pay.

5.33 (Facebook User Base Growth) According to CNNMoney.com, Facebook hit one billion users
in October 2012. Using the compound-growth technique you learned in Fig. 5.6 and assuming
its user base grows at a rate of 4% per month, how many months will it take for Facebook to grow
its user base to 1.5 billion users? How many months will it take for Facebook to grow its user base
to two billion users?

GUI and Graphics Case Study Exercises
5.1 Draw 12 concentric circles in the center of a JPanel (Fig. 5.29). The innermost circle
should have a radius of 10 pixels, and each successive circle should have a radius 10 pixels larger than
the previous one. Begin by finding the center of the JPanel. To get the upper-left corner of a circle,
move up one radius and to the left one radius from the center. The width and height of the bounding
rectangle are both the same as the circle’s diameter (i.e., twice the radius).
