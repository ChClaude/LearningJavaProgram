You cannot invoke a subclass only method on a superclass variable;
You need to downcast the superclass variable before calling a subclass only method.

PayRollSystemTest.java
Similarly, if lines 44 and 49 used superclass variable currentEmployee to invoke subclass-
only methods getBaseSalary and setBaseSalary, we’d receive “cannot find
symbol” compilation errors at these lines.

Similarly, if lines 56 and 60 used superclass variable currentEmployee to invoke subclass-
only methods getBaseSalary and setBaseSalary, we’d receive “cannot find
symbol” compilation errors at these lines. Attempting to invoke subclass-only methods via
a superclass variable is not allowed—even though lines 56 and 60 execute only if
instanceof in line 49 returns true to indicate that currentEmployee holds a reference to
a BasePlusCommissionEmployee object. Using a superclass Employee variable, we can
invoke only methods found in class Employee—earnings, toString and Employee’s get
and set methods.
